This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving closures and loops. The `myFunction` uses a `setTimeout` within a loop, intending to log the value of `i` at each iteration. However, due to the way closures work in JavaScript, by the time the `setTimeout` functions execute, the loop has already completed, and `i` will be its final value (10). The solution demonstrates how to use `let` or immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs) to create closures that capture the correct value of `i` for each iteration.
